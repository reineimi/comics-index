# comics-index
> A Lua script that generates JSON tables of comic volumes & chapters, and then parses them into an HTML file written in [Va2](https://github.com/reineimi/va2) frontend library.

> [!TIP]
> Guide on how to run Lua files on Windows <a href='https://github.com/reineimi/lua-on-windows' target='_blank'>can be viewed here</a>.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
This version uses the online version of the Va2 library. For the offline version, head to: [("local" branch)](https://github.com/reineimi/comics-index/tree/local)

## Usage
```
1.	Put this script in the directory of the
	downloaded comics you want to view.

2.	Rename the directories following the rules below:

	Directory tree before changes:
		> My Comic Book
			> Volume 1 - The Beginning
			> Volume 2 - The Progress
			> Chapter 12
			> Chapter 13

	After changes:
		> My_Comic_Book
			> v01
			> v02
			> 012
			> 013
			cover.jpg

3.	Only after that, run the script, and then open
	the generated index.html file in your browser.
```
> [!NOTE]
> Volumes under 10 must include a `0` at the start, same goes for chapters under 100, e.g: `v09`, `009`, `099`

> [!WARNING]
> Be wary of the fact that the opened HTML documents may require one or several gigabytes of RAM.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the colors in the **Settings** menu, which is accessible in the **context menu** that appears on **right click/long tap**.
